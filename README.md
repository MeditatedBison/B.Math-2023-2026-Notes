On Android/ iOS devices, If you try to open some Notes like [[1. Before Midsem Prob 2 Notes by AKSHAT MISHRA.pdf]](those which are in pdf format), you may get an error that `The plugin is not supported` .

# How to Contribute?
I suggest you to use Obsidian, 
however you can type the whole Lecture, Solution in Markdown on github Discussion itself.  
But writing pages of lectures or solutions on github itself, may mess up the place.

- Use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to create the Notes or write up the Solutions
- then Share the Markdown File on Github Discussions.
- You will be Mentioned for your contribution in the website notes/solutions.

Installing Obsidian:
